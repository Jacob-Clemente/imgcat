\f[B]imgcat\f[] \- cat, but for images
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]imgcat\f[] [\f[B]\-w\f[] \f[I]COLS\f[]|\f[B]\-R\f[]] [\f[B]\-d\f[]
\f[I]MODE\f[]] [\f[I]options\f[]] \f[I]image.ext\f[]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]imgcat\f[] prints images to your terminal screen.
.PP
By default, the image is printed at the full width and color depth
detected for your terminal.
These can be overridden using \f[B]\-w\f[] to adjust the maximum width
or \f[B]\-R\f[] to prevent resizing, even if the image is too big to fit
in the terminal; and \f[B]\-d\f[] to explicitly the set color depth.
.PP
\f[B]Make sure your \f[C]TERM\f[] environment variable is set to a
terminfo with the full capabilities of you terminal!\f[] See
\f[B]Troubleshooting\f[] if you\[aq]re having a problem with this.
.PP
If the output is not a terminal (that is, output is redirected to a
file, or piped into another program), then the image is \f[B]not\f[]
resized and the color depth is set to 8 colors.
Overriding both width and color depth still work.
.SS Options
.TP
.B \f[B]\-d\f[] \f[I]MODE\f[], \f[B]\-\-depth\f[]=\f[I]MODE\f[]
Explicitly set the output color depth to one of \f[B]ansi\f[],
\f[B]8\f[] (alias of \f[B]ansi\f[]), \f[B]256\f[], or \f[B]iterm\f[].
If not provided, the output color depth will be inferred with
\f[C]tput\ colors\f[].
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]\-R\f[], \f[B]\-\-no\-resize\f[]
Does not resize the image to fit the terminal\[aq]s width.
Overrides \f[B]\-\-width\f[].
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]\-w\f[] \f[I]COLS\f[], \f[B]\-\-width\f[]=\f[I]COLS\f[]
Shrink the image to \f[I]COLS\f[] characters wide (maintaining aspect
ratio).
Does nothing if \f[B]\-\-no\-resize\f[] is provided, or if the image is
already as small as the provided width.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]\-\-8\f[], \f[B]\-\-ansi\f[]
Set the output colour depth to 8.
Same as \f[B]\-\-depth=8\f[].
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]\-\-256\f[]
Set the output colour depth to 256.
Same as \f[B]\-\-depth=256\f[].
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]\-\-iterm2\f[]
Set the output to iTerm inline image mode.
Same as \f[B]\-\-depth=iterm2\f[].

.SS iTerm2 3.0
.PP
\f[B]imgcat\f[] supports iTerm2\[aq]s full\-color inline images (use
\f[B]\-d iterm\f[] to explicitly enable this).
However, iTerm2 is bundled with a script that is also called
\f[B]imgcat\f[]! To use this program in preference to the script bundled
with iTerm2, edit your shell\[aq]s configuration file such that, after
the line that sources iTerm2\[aq]s shell integration and utilities, you
unalias its built\-in script:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
unalias\ imgcat
\f[]
.fi
.SS Troubleshooting
.PP
First, test how many colors your terminal can output:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ tput\ colors
256
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If this is not what you expect, you might want to change your
\f[C]TERM\f[] environment variable.
For example, iTerm2 users will probably want the following:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ export\ TERM=xterm\-256color
\f[]
.fi
.PP
However, it\[aq]s better that your terminal emulator reports itself with
the proper value for \f[C]TERM\f[].
For iTerm2, again, look under the current profile settings > Terminal >
Terminal Emulation > and change "Report Terminal Type".

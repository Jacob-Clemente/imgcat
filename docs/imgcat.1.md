# NAME

**imgcat** - cat, but for images

# SYNOPSIS

| **imgcat** [**-w** _COLS_|**-R**] [**-d** _MODE_] [_options_] _image.ext_

# DESCRIPTION

**imgcat** prints images to your terminal screen. Yes, indeed it does.

By default, the image is printed at the full width and colour depth
detected for your terminal. These can be overridden using **-w** to
adjust the maximum width or **-R** to prevent resizing, even if the
image is too big to fit in the terminal; and **-d** to explicitly the
set color depth.

__Make sure your `TERM` environment variable is set to a terminfo with
the full capabilities of you terminal!__ See **Troubleshooting** if
you're having a problem with this.

If the output stream is not a terminal (that is, output is redirected to
a file, or piped into another program), then the image is **not**
resized to the size of the terminal. It does, however, uses the color
depth of terminal set in the `TERM` environment variable. Overriding
both width and color depth still work.

## Options

**-w** _COLS_, **--width**=_COLS_
  ~ Shrink the image to _COLS_ characters wide (maintaining aspect ratio).
  Does nothing if **--no-resize** is provided, or if the image is
  already as small as the provided width.

**-d** _MODE_, **--depth**=_MODE_
  ~ Explicitly set the output color depth to one of **ansi**, **8**
  (alias of **ansi**), or **256**. If not provided, the output color
  depth will be inferred with `tput colors`.

**-R**, **--no-resize**
  ~ Does not resize the image to fit the terminal's width. Overrides
  **--width**.

## Troubleshooting

First, test how many colors your terminal can output:

    $ tput colors
    256

If this is not what you expect, you might want to change your `TERM`
environment variable. For example, iTerm2 users will probably want the
following:

    $ export TERM=xterm-256color

However, it's better that your terminal emulator reports itself with the
proper value for `TERM`. For iTerm2, again, look under the current
profile settings > Terminal > Terminal Emulation > and change "Report
Terminal Type".
